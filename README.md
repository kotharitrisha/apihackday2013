DocX is a solution for maintaining and updating health records in developing countries via a text message.
Patients can update and receive a log of their previous health records by simply sending a text message to a fixed number.

This is a much more viable solution to the world where 86% of users have a phone device, but less than 18% 
have a smartphone.
